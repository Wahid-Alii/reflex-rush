# 🚀 Built a Fun Reflex Rush Game with Vue.js 3! 🎯


## Just wrapped up a small but exciting project using Vue.js with the Composition API – a simple game to test reaction speed! ⚡

Here’s how it works:
🔹 Click "Play" to start.
🔹 Wait for a random delay… ⏳
🔹 When the box appears, tap it ASAP!
🔹 Your reaction time determines your rank:
🏆 Legendary – Under 250ms
👍 Good – 251-350ms
🐢 Slow – Above 350ms

## This was a fun way to experiment with Vue's reactivity and event handling, and it’s surprisingly addictive. 😆
